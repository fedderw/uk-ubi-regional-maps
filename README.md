The geojson file for UK administrative boundaries comes from this [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dorianlazar/uk-regions-geojson?select=uk_regions.geojson) page

Both the baseline_regions.csv and ubi_regions.csv files were created by Nikhil Woodruff using the UBI Center's open-fisca microsimulation model.
